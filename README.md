sql_scripts
===========

This is a set of sql scripts to create the default CRUD stored procedures for a given table. 
Also I added some scripts to generate C# code based on the CRUD procedures. 

These scripts are usefull for jobs like mine  where it is forbiden to use dynamic sql queries, which makes the use of tools like 
NHybernate or Entity Framework troblesome. 

I know, I know, time to find a new job.


But at least the scripts are there in case someone needs.
